# cpp-render

This project demonstrates rendering a 3D model using C++.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code:
    ```bash
    g++ src/main.cpp -o out/app
    ```

2. Execute the application:
    ```bash
    ./out/app
    ```

3. Zoom out your terminal to view the 3D model.

## Requirements

- g++ compiler
- A terminal that supports rendering

## Project Structure

```
cpp-render/
├── src/
│   └── main.cpp
├── out/
│   └── app (generated after compilation)
└── Readme.md
```

## Notes

- Ensure your terminal is large enough to properly display the 3D model.
- Modify `src/main.cpp` to customize the rendering logic.
- Contributions are welcome!
